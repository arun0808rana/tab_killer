# Why?

Because chrome doesn't have hotkeys for killing tabs. And installing an extension that does this also does a `lot` and I only wanted the killing feature.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Goto `Extension` menu in chrome and enable `Developer Mode`
3. Click on `Load unpackaged` and select the cloned folder

## Hotkeys

1. kills tabs to the right of the current tab using `ctrl+shift+right_arrow`
2. kills tabs to the left of the current tab using `ctrl+shift+left_arrow`
